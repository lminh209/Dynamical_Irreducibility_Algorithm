# Algorithm for Determining the Dynamical Irreducibility of Cubic Polynomials over Finite Fields

## Description

This algorithm was developed as part of the research project on Dynamical Irreducibiilty of Polynomials over Finite Fields at Mount Holyoke College, done under the mentorship of Professor Tori Day.

It is used for determining if a cubic polynomial of the form f(x)=a~3~x^3+a~2~x^2+a~1~x+a~0 is dynamically irreducible over a given finite field of order q (q being a prime or prime power).

***Tech used:*** Magma

## Reflections

Through this project, I was involved in math research for the first time - which led to a series of other first-times: learning Magma, presenting about out research at MHC math lunch, and finding out how fun math can be!

The research process was a great learning opportunity. Beyond abstract algebra and Magma, I learned how to be patient with myself. Weeks of reading theories, coding, testing, debugging had led me out of my comfort zone, step by step. I practiced breaking down into pieces a problem that seemed daunting at first sight, and solving it piece by piece. Then I learned how to tackle problems calmly and confidently - by letting myself take time, and believing there is a solution waiting to be found. I learned to voice my questions and concerns, and appreciated how lucky I was to be among great people who are willing to give me support and guidance.

## Acknowledgement

I want to thank my mentor in this project, Professor Tori Day, for giving me the opportunity to be involved in this project. I learned a lot not from your knowledgeableness, enthusiasm and patience.
